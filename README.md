 Project Overview

AGRITECH is an innovative solution aimed at modernizing agriculture through the application of advanced technology. By integrating machine learning models with a robust backend built on Django REST framework, this project enables users to analyze and forecast key agricultural metrics. 

 Features

- Machine Learning Integration: Predictive models to assist in agricultural decision-making.
- Django REST Framework: A scalable backend to handle API requests and responses.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- Real-time Data Processing: Efficient handling of large datasets to provide timely insights.

 Technologies Used

- Python
- Django REST Framework
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Database: SQLite (default, can be configured to other databases)
- Version Control: Git
- Hosting: Localhost or any cloud provider

 Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash

   cd Agritech
   ```

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply Migrations:
